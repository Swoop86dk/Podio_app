#Podio app

## Before you start

Make sure you have downloaded and installed the following:
- Visual Studio Code IDE (download here: https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- NodeJS (download here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Git (download here: https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Inside the Visual Studio Code IDE go to the Extensions tab which is found on the left sidebar and enter "Live Server" in the search field. Now click on the extension called "Live Server 5.6.1" and download / install Live Server to be able to run the server.

Once you have that set up you can move on to the next part.

2. click the index.html file inside the project.
3. right click anywhere on the code page and select the option to "Open with Live Server"
The Live Server will start up and run at ```http://localhost:5500```
