#Podio app

## Before you start

Make sure you have downloaded and installed the following:
- Visual Studio Code IDE (download here: https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- NodeJS (download here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Git (download here: https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Inside the Visual Studio Code IDE go to the Extensions tab which is found on the left sidebar and enter "Live Server" in the search field. Now click on the extension called "Live Server 5.6.1" and download / install Live Server to be able to run the server.

Once you have that set up you can move on to the next part.

## To run the app:

Option 1: (With Visual Studio Code IDE and Live Server library installed!)

1. open up a terminal and cd to the project folders main.
2. click the index.html file inside the project.
3. right click anywhere on the code page and select the option to "Open with Live Server"
The Live Server will start up and run at ```http://localhost:5500```

## App running:

Once the server is running you will be prompted to log in with a valid username and password (Podio login credentials).
If validation was completed and succesfull you will be presented with a list of contracts.

---- Thoughts on the project ----

A lot of time was spent on exploring Podio, reading up on the API documentation and debugging the response data.
In hindsight I would have rather build a more enhanced RESTapi that would work better with the PushBullet api as I was not able to get it working in time. Hence I was only able to complete half of the assignment. 

Objectives:

- Fetch data from Podio using http (DONE)
- Load and visualize data on web ui (DONE)
- Implement Pushbullet for sending SMS notifications to the client and save a copy of the message in Podio (Not done)
